This repository contains the taxonomic composition of the sequencing runs of project [PRJNA948658](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA948658), as calculated by the [SRA Taxonomy Analysis Tool](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sra-taxonomy-analysis-tool/). The classification results were filtered using script `extract_mammals.py` to extract the lines corresponding to mammals. The full taxonomic composition is available [here](https://t.co/o7fTey5YhX).
